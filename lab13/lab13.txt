As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete events in the schedule.


Imagine that you want to change the details of an event or remove it. These steps will show you how:
	1. Click on the schedule icon at the bottom of your screen.
	2. Press the more options icon on the desired event,
	3. Click either edit to change the details of an event or delete to get remove it.
